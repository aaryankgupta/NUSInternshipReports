# NUSInternshipReports

This repository contains reports about my ongoing research and notes on research papers I have been reading in my ongoing internship with Prof. Kuldeep Meel and his PhD student Yash Pote at NUS School of Computing.

My work so far has been revolving around two tasks:
1. Attempting to parametrise an edge isoperimetric inequality derived by Rashtchian [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10435.pdf) for powers of the hypercube using treewidth of primal and dual graphs of the CNF formula corresponding to the hypercube.
2. Analysing experimentally and theoretically the effect of using equally sparse hashing matrices instead of sampling matrices from the Rennes family of hashing matrices described [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14692.pdf).

If successful, these tasks will help improve the probabilistic bounds of [ApproxMC](https://github.com/meelgroup/approxmc): a sparse XOR-hashing based approximate model counter.
